(In some of the earlier episodes, it was also referred to as \"Rockville\"). In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs, saber-toothed tigers, woolly mammoths, and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen. Like their mid-20th century peers, these cavemen listen to records, live in split-level homes, and eat out at restaurants, yet their technology is made entirely from pre-industrial materials and largely powered through the use of various animals. For example, the cars are made out of stone, wood, and animal skins, and powered by the passengers' feet (as in the theme song, \"Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet\").","name":"The Flintstones","name_cn":"摩登原始人","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":31},{"name":"童年","count":31},{"name":"美国","count":18},{"name":"情景喜剧","count":16},{"name":"TV","count":13},{"name":"1960","count":10},{"name":"搞笑","count":9},{"name":"迪士尼","count":8},{"name":"童年系列","count":6},{"name":"1960s","count":3},{"name":"子供向","count":2},{"name":"Hanna-Barbera","count":1},{"name":"Bea_Benaderet","count":1},{"name":"Mel_Blanc","count":1},{"name":"YL","count":1},{"name":"TVA-01","count":1},{"name":"1970.00","count":1},{"name":"Jean_Vander_Pyl","count":1},{"name":"Hanna-Barbera_Productions","count":1},{"name":"60年代","count":1},{"name":"没看全","count":1},{"name":"原创","count":1},{"name":"动画","count":1},{"name":"杂","count":1},{"name":"60s","count":1},{"name":"Hoyt_Curtin","count":1},{"name":"Joseph_Barbera","count":1},{"name":"William_Hanna","count":1},{"name":"Alan_Reed","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"摩登原始人"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"弗林特斯通一家"},{"v":"聪明笨伯"}]},{"key":"话数","value":"166"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"1960年9月30日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"ABC"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"1966年4月1日"},{"key":"制片人","value":"Howard Hanson"},{"key":"导演","value":"Joseph Barbera, William Hanna"},{"key":"脚本","value":"Joseph Barbera, William Hanna"},{"key":"音乐","value":"Ted Nichols, Will Schaefer, Hoyt Curtin"},{"key":"剪辑","value":"Greg Watson, Donald Douglas, Warner E.
