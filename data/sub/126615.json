SpongeBob lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying. When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants (Season 3)","name_cn":"海绵宝宝 第三季","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":62},{"name":"童年","count":52},{"name":"TV","count":50},{"name":"搞笑","count":43},{"name":"2002","count":23},{"name":"日常","count":18},{"name":"美国","count":18},{"name":"原创","count":11},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":9},{"name":"电视","count":9},{"name":"2006","count":4},{"name":"动漫世界","count":3},{"name":"没全部看完","count":3},{"name":"北美","count":2},{"name":"没看全","count":2},{"name":"2000-2009","count":2},{"name":"奇幻","count":2},{"name":"动画","count":2},{"name":"正常","count":1},{"name":"外国","count":1},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）2001","count":1},{"name":"Nickelodeon","count":1},{"name":"短单元","count":1},{"name":"美动","count":1},{"name":"剧集","count":1},{"name":"喜欢的作品","count":1},{"name":"TVA-01","count":1},{"name":"系列短片","count":1},{"name":"美国动画","count":1},{"name":"一般向","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"海绵宝宝 第三季"},{"key":"话数","value":"36"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2001年10月5日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2004年10月11日"}],"rating":{"rank":1011,"total":230,"count":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":2,"4":2,"5":8,"6":21,"7":78,"8":83,"9":14,"10":21},"score":7.5},"total_episodes":36,"collection":{"on_hold":8,"dropped":14,"wish":13,"collect":504,"doing":6},"id":126615,"eps":36,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
